A chrome extension used for productivity to map tasks to goals with journal entries

toDO:
- goals update: need to work on actual edit, show and display goal.
- jasmine tests! (standard page). 
- Still zen mode for goals?
- when done all complete: then need to show no more!
- tour
 - need to make it so can get all goals
 - can add those goals to task (task can have no goal)
 - can edit task to include different goals
 - if task selects goal that was complete, makes goal back to uncomplete
 - task can only select goals that are uncomplete? (this contradicts above statement)
 - can click highlight for indidivual goal and it shows which task aligns with which goal
 - should add colour to each goal so that they are shown to be outlined in diff colours and when task selects which goal, it matches with a diff colour label (this cannot be changed by the user currently)

 - need to reset so not multiple clicks (like edit one, doesn't submit, but then clicks edit on another)
 - stack colours for show
